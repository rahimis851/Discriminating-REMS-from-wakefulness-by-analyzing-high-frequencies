The algorithm presented here is based on a study by Rahimi et al. (2023), titled "Analyzing high frequencies from single-channel EEG recordings in mice to differentiate between rapid eye movement sleep and wakefulness". The study was a collaboration between the Medical University of Innsbruck, Austria, and the Technical University of Munich, Germany. The researchers collected EEG recordings from three different locations, namely the motor, sensory, and visual cortex, and found that the best results were obtained from the visual cortex. To make the algorithm more accessible, they have provided one hour demo files of EEG recordings from each electrode location, along with labels in an excel sheet.
